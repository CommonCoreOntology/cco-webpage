<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
  <h2>How do I open CCO to look through its content?</h2>
    <p>CCO can be viewed on its official <a href="[https://protege.stanford.edu/](https://github.com/CommonCoreOntology/CommonCoreOntologies)" target="_blank">github repo</a>. There are ttl files for each of the sub-ontologies that compose CCO, as well as a file compiling all of these ontologies together titled 'AllCoreOntology.ttl'. There is also a file compiling all of CCO along with the Modal Relations Ontology that can be found in the 'cco-merged' folder.</p> 
  <p>CCO can be viewed from ontology-builder programs such as Protege, which can be downloaded for free from <a href="https://protege.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">here</a>. Once Protege is downloaded, CCO can be opened in the program by going to the CCO github repo, opening a CCO ttl file, clicking "Raw", copying the URL at the top, opening Protege, click 'File', click 'Open from URL', pasting the URL into the box that opens, and clicking 'Okay'.</p>
