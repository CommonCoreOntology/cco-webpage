<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
  <h2>How do I open CCO to look through its content?</h2>
    <p>CCO can be viewed on its official <a href="https://github.com/CommonCoreOntology/CommonCoreOntologies" target="_blank">github repo</a>. There are ttl files for each of the sub-ontologies that compose CCO, as well as a file compiling all of these ontologies together titled 'AllCoreOntology.ttl'. There is also a file compiling all of CCO along with the Modal Relations Ontology that can be found in the 'cco-merged' folder.</p> 
    <p>CCO can be viewed from ontology-builder programs such as Protege, which can be downloaded for free from <a href="https://protege.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">here</a>. Once Protege is downloaded, CCO can be opened in the program by going to the CCO github repo, opening a CCO ttl file, clicking "Raw", copying the URL at the top, opening Protege, clicking 'File', clicking 'Open from URL', pasting the URL into the box that opens, and clicking 'Okay'.</p>
  <h2>What is a 'Mid-Level Ontology'?</h2>
    <p>Top-Level Ontologies represent and define entities at a very general level of abstraction. Its terms are applicable to a wide range of ontologies. Domain Ontologies represent and define entities that are highly specific to a particular domain. Therefore, Mid-Level Ontologies represent and define entities at a less general level of abstraction than Top-Level Ontologies but are more general than Domain Ontologies. More information on defining Mid-Level Ontologies can be found <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17757" target="_blank">here</a>. An <a href="https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/3195/11025/" target="_blank">IEEE Working Group</a> is developing standards outlining requirements for Mid-Level Ontologies.</p>
  <h2>Who 'Owns' CCO?</h2>
    <p>CCO is a collaborative project that has been developed by Ron Rudnicki, the ontology team at CUBRC, Inc., and ontologists affiliated with NCOR. Future releases of CCO will be overseen by the Common Core Board of Directors. We are open to further collaboration with any interested parties. CCO is openly available under a BSD-3 license.</p>
  <h2>What's the Easy Way to Use CCO?</h2>
    <p>placeholder</p>
  <h2>Why Aren't There More Axioms in CCO?</h2>
    <p>placeholder</p>
  <h2>Who Pays for CCO?</h2>
    <p>placeholder</p>
  <h2>Why is CCO so Popular?</h2>
    <p>There are many reasons that CCO is so widely used. One is that it has been built as an expansion of Basic Formal Ontology, the most widely used top-level ontology. CCO has also been built by professional ontologists who have carefully crafted its terms and definitions. Since it was developed by CUBRC, Inc., with close collaboration with the US Department of Defense and Intelligence Communities, it has already been tested for usability in real-world scenarios. </p>
  <h2>Who Should I Reach Out to For a Conversation With the Governance Board?</h2>
    <p>The Governance Board can be reached by messaging Dr. John Beverley johnbeve[@]buffalo.edu. He can also be contacted to join the CCO office hours, which meet virtually on Teams biweekly on Fridays, 11am - 12pm.</p>
  <h2>How Often Does CCO Release Updates?</h2>
    <p>placeholder</p>
  <h2>Is CCO a Standard?</h2>
    <p>CCO is a baseline standard for all formal ontology work with the Department of Defense and Intelligence Communities, as outlined <a href="https://dailynous.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/memo-dod-applied-ontology.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. The <a href="https://sagroups.ieee.org/oswg/" target="_blank">IEEE P3195 Standard for Requirements for a Mid-Level Ontology and Extensions working group</a> is also reviewing CCO to become the first mid-level ontology standard.</p>
  <h2>How is CCO Versioned?</h2>
    <p>Version control is tracked with Git on the official <a href="https://github.com/CommonCoreOntology/CommonCoreOntologies/tree/develop" target="_blank">CCO github repo</a>CCO github repo.</p>
  <h2>Does CCO Use the Temporalized Relations from BFO?</h2>
    <p>CCO does not use the Temporalized Relations extension of BFO.</p>
  <h2>What's Going on With the Modal Relations Ontology?</h2>
    <p>The Modal Relations Ontology is not officially part of the Common Core Ontologies. For those interested in using it, a ttl file of CCO and the Modal Relations Ontology is offered on the official CCO github repo <a href="https://github.com/CommonCoreOntology/CommonCoreOntologies/blob/develop/cco-merged/MergedAllCoreOntology-v1.5-2024-02-14.ttl" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
