<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
  <h2>How do I open CCO to look through its content?</h2>
    <p>CCO can be viewed on its official <a href="https://github.com/CommonCoreOntology/CommonCoreOntologies" target="_blank">github repo</a>. There are ttl files for each of the sub-ontologies that compose CCO, as well as a file compiling all of these ontologies together titled 'AllCoreOntology.ttl'. There is also a file compiling all of CCO along with the Modal Relations Ontology that can be found in the 'cco-merged' folder.</p> 
    <p>CCO can be viewed from ontology-builder programs such as Protege, which can be downloaded for free from <a href="https://protege.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">here</a>. Once Protege is downloaded, CCO can be opened in the program by going to the CCO github repo, opening a CCO ttl file, clicking "Raw", copying the URL at the top, opening Protege, clicking 'File', clicking 'Open from URL', pasting the URL into the box that opens, and clicking 'Okay'.</p>
  <h2>What is a 'Mid-Level Ontology'?</h2>
    <p>Top-Level Ontologies represent and define entities at a very general level of abstraction. Its terms are applicable to a wide range of ontologies. Domain Ontologies represent and define entities that are highly specific to a particular domain. Therefore, Mid-Level Ontologies represent and define entities at a less general level of abstraction than Top-Level Ontologies but are more general than Domain Ontologies. More information on defining Mid-Level Ontologies can be found <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17757" target+"_blank">here</a>. An <a href="https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/3195/11025/"_blank">IEEE Working Group</a> is developing standards outlining requirements for Mid-Level Ontologies.</p>
