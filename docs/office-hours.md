<h1>BFO-CCO Office Hours</h1>

<p>
Given the growing importance of Basic Formal Ontology and the Common Core Ontologies across domains such as <a href="https://www.buffalo.edu/cas/philosophy/news/latestnews/smith-top-level-ontologies.html" class="custom-color">defense and intelligence</a>, <a href="https://obofoundry.org/" class="custom-color">biology and medicine</a>, and <a href="https://spec.industrialontologies.org/iof/" class="custom-color">service and manufacturing</a>, the lead developers of BFO and CCO host biweekly office hours to support transparency and accessibility around their development and use. These stakeholder-led sessions provide a forum for questions, feedback, and discussion of practical modeling decisions and real-world application.
</p>

  <li>When: Biweekly on Fridays, starting May 31st 2024, 11am to 12pm</li>
