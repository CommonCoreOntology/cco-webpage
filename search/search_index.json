CCO - initiated by CUBRC, Inc. in 2010 under an IARPA Knowledge Discovery and Dissemination grant - is widely-used in defense and intelligence sectors to support data standardization, interoperability, reproducibility, and automated reasoning across numerous domains. Accordingly, CCO development and application was, for many years, conducted without much transparency. As of 2017, however, CCO has been available under a BSD-3 license with a public GitHub repository open to collaboration. Making CCO publicly available has led to significant increase of interest in CCO development. For example, in 2022 the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) P3195 Standard for Requirements for a Mid-Level Ontology and Extensions working group initiated a review of CCO to become the first mid-level ontology standard. More recently, in 2024 CCO was endorsed as a \u201cbaseline standard\u201d for all formal ontology development across the Department of Defense and Intelligence Community.        Common Core Ontologies Common Core Module Scope Geospatial Ontology Designed to represent sites, spatial regions, and other entities, especially those that are located near the surface of Earth, as well as the relations that hold between them. Information Entity Ontology Designed to represent generic types of information as well as the relationships between information and other entities. Event Ontology Designed to represent processual entities, especially those performed by agents, that occur within multiple domains. Time Ontology Designed to represent temporal regions and the relations that hold between them. Agent Ontology Designed to represent agents, especially persons and organizations, and their roles. Quality Ontology Designed to represent a range of attributes of entities especially qualities, realizable entities, and process profiles. Units of Measure Ontology Designed to represent standard measurement units that are used when measuring various attributes of entities. Currency Unit Ontology Designed to represent currencies that are issued and used by countries. Facility Ontology Designed to represent buildings and campuses that are designed to serve some specific purpose, and which are common to multiple domains. Artifact Ontology Designed to represent artifacts that are common to multiple domains along with their models, specifications, and functions. Extended Relations Ontology Designed to represent many of the relations that hold between entities at the level of the mid-level Common Core Ontologies. <p>CCO modules are not intended to provide an exhaustive taxonomy of all possible entities within scope but instead provide guardrails for extending the top-level semantics of BFO into more specific domains. For example, the Artifact Ontology is a guide for extending the semantics of artifact into specific domains of interest, such as medical artifacts, scientific artifacts, military artifacts, and so on.</p>"},{"location":"affiliates/","title":"Affiliates","text":"Organizations"},{"location":"board/","title":"Board of Directors","text":"Board of Directors The Common Core Ontologies (CCO) <p>         The Common Core Ontologies (CCO) have become, over the last decade, an increasingly important resource for the U.S. Government. This mid-level ontology suite is currently used by dozens of organizations and deployed in critical systems in active operation. To date, CCO has been developed and maintained by Ron Rudnicki and the ontology team at CUBRC, Inc., who have overseen successive releases of CCO that have always sought to meet the needs of a growing number of end users. Through the ingenuity and discipline of this team, CCO has remained a touchstone for ontology development, reducing the time needed to develop jointly interoperable high-quality domain ontologies aligned to Basic Formal Ontology (BFO). As a result, CCO has continued to receive greater adoption, and will become a central component of the DoD IC Ontology Foundry. In particular, both BFO and CCO have been directed for use in the communities as baseline standards for ontology development.     </p> <p>         In recognition of the need for CCO to continue to scale and evolve, future releases of CCO will be overseen by The Common Core Board of Directors, which will have an established charter and bylaws and will be composed of representatives from stake-holder organizations who have been involved in CCO development through the past decade.      </p> <p>         This board shall be charged with ensuring that CCO is openly available, well-maintained, responsive to user needs and technological and theoretical changes, and independent of any undue influence imposed by a single project or organization.

By introducing entities such as geospatial boundary, geospatial line, and geospatial polygon, CCO\u2019s geospatial design patterns resemble those of GeoSPARQL which maintains a vocabulary of points and polygons from which users may construct query patterns concerning spatial location. However, GeoSPARQL does not provide query extensions or native support for interactions between both space and time, instead directing users to leverage OWL TIME to model the latter. In contrast, CCO integrates spatial, temporal, and spatiotemporal aspects of tracking.</p> <p>Suppose there is a need to represent the path taken by a ground vehicle over some geospatial region. The first figure below illustrates how such a use case would be modeled using CCO. The class material artifact - a material entity designed by some agent to realize some function - is the parent of vehicle, instances of which convey material entities from one location to another. Subclasses of vehicle are divided largely along the lines of aircraft, ground vehicle, spacecraft, and watercraft, all of which are designed to realize some conveyance function across some environment type. While any instance of truck is a ground vehicle, the latter class is further divided into rail transport vehicle \u2013 conveyance by railway - and ground motor vehicle \u2013 conveyance by motive power by an engine absent rails \u2013 where we find truck.</p> <p>Tracing the path of an instance of truck involves identifying an act of vehicle use in which that truck participates. The act of vehicle use in turn has process part some location changes which occur at instances of vehicle track point. Generally, the relation occurs at holds between a process and a site, where a site is a three-dimensional immaterial entity whose boundaries coincide with some material entity, e.g. a hole in a straw, the trunk of a car. To say then that a process part of the act of vehicle use occurs at some vehicle track point is to imply the latter is a site. Each instance of vehicle track point is associated with latitude and longitude text values, and each is a part of distinct instances of geospatial region, which is a site at or near the surface of the Earth. Each geospatial region has a different location, such as Buffalo NY, or the New York State Thruway Exit 33 Toll Plaza, or Rome NY.</p> <p>The temporal aspect of this scenario is illustrated in the next figure below. Suppose the act of vehicle use occurs at the Baghdad city of al-Kadhimya over the course of several months. One such occurrence happened during the month of May 2004. Any act of vehicle use will happen over a temporal interval, which is a continuous temporal region of one-dimension exhibiting no gaps, such as May 17th at 1:38PM EDT. This time of day is an interval during May 2004, which in this scenario is an interval during a multi- month temporal interval, perhaps consisting of June, July, and August as well. Note that, despite the label choice, multi-month temporal interval may, unlike the BFO class temporal interval, exhibit discontinuities and temporal gaps. The class exists to track repeated occurrences of a process across months. For more fine-grained representations, CCO additionally contains similarly contains multi-day temporal interval, multi- second temporal interval and so on.</p> <p>These resources allow for the representation of partial descriptions of processes that refer to the same event using different granularities of time. For example, the statements \u201cThe truck is in Baghdad at 8:42PM on March 17th, 2004\u201d and \u201cA truck was in Baghdad on the evening of March 17th, 2004\u201d may refer to the same event, and if so, would be linked using interval during relations.</p>"},{"location":"information/","title":"Information Model","text":"<p>The Information Entity Ontology distinguishes content of information both from the information bearing entities which may carry that content and from the patterns exhibited by those information bearing entities. A computer monitor screen, for example, bears qualities such as shape and color that are said to concretize information content entities, i.e. generically dependent continuants that are about something. These distinctions allow for flexible representations of various relationships arising among information bearing entities, patterns, and information content entities. Any of the following patterns \u2018\u03c0\u2019, \u2018pi\u2019, \u20183.14...\u2019, or \u20183.14159265358979323...\u2019 on your monitor might concretize the same information content entity. Similarly, such patterns in a textbook would concretize the same information content entity.</p> <p>Importantly, in making this trifold distinction, CCO denies that information transmission, provenance, and evaluation can be adequately represented without reference to information carriers. Carriers are, for example, crucial when modeling the provenance and pedigree of data across multi-modal sensors [24]. That said, users are not required to track provenance; CCO includes an annotation property is tokenized by to link literal values directly to instances of information content entity without having to represent relevant information content entities.</p> <p>Designative information content entities are used to uniquely denote entities, while directive information content entities consist of either propositions or images used to prescribe behaviors, actions, designs, etc. The class descriptive information content entity consists of propositions used to describe some entity and is the parent to the extensive collection of measurement and measurement unit CCO classes. CCO distinguishes what is being measured, information about what is measured, units encoding measurements, and the findings regarding measurements. For example, measuring John\u2019s height in inches involves John, a length quality that inheres in John, the inch unit of measure, and the value associated with John\u2019s height, e.g. \u201c70\u201d</p> <p>To illustrate features of CCO\u2019s information design pattern, consider that automobiles are often designed by agents or organizations according to some blueprint or modeling pattern. The Agent Ontology contains classes for agents, organizations, and roles borne by either. In CCO, agents are in every case those material entities capable of performing planned acts, i.e. acts directed by some directive information content entity. Moreover, by leveraging a sub-relation of participates in, namely agent in, CCO distinguishes between agents making causally relevant contributions to some process as opposed to passive contributions. For example, engineers working for Honda at some point created a blueprint for the Honda Civic, and so provided causally relevant contributions to the creation of this blueprint. Expanding on this example, CCO introduces the class artifact model, a directive information content entity that prescribes a common set of functions and qualities to inhere in a set of artifact instances. Instances of artifact model are, moreover, designated by specific artifact model names, such as \u201c2018 Tesla Model 3-EU var2\u201d which may similarly be represented using CCO resources</p> <p>Given an artifact model prescribing the production features for a type of automobile, manufacturers also engage in planned acts the goal of which is to satisfy the artifact model prescriptions. Manufacturers may, for example, produce an automobile that is meant to bear a certain weight or have a certain transportation range function. These dependent entities will then inhere in the automobile produced and may be measured by some information content entity. As depicted in Figure 3, each ratio measurement information content entity corresponds to its own information bearing entity, which we may assume without loss of generality that in this case is part of some database or table. With respect to the weight of the automobile, the relevant database part has a literal value \u201c1250\u201d and uses measurement unit kilogram measurement unit.</p> <p>Artifact models are rarely, if ever, faithfully produced. CCO resources allow for representations of the goals of an artifact model, the extent to which attempts to produce that model were successful, and manufacturer plans in pursuit of such production. When representing data reflecting failures of plans, missed opportunities, or perhaps even unobtainable goals, such nuanced representations are invaluable.</p>"},{"location":"office-hours/","title":"Office Hours","text":"<p> BFO-CCO Office Hours </p> BFO-CCO Office Hours <p>Given the growing importance of Basic Formal Ontology and the Common Core Ontologies suite, in defense and intelligence, biology and medicine, as well as service and manufacturing, there is a need for transparency concerning the development and maintenance of these artifacts.</p> <p>With this in mind, the lead developers of BFO and CCO will hold biweekly \"office hours\" for stakeholders with questions, concerns, comments, or compliments regarding these standards.
