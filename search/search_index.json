CCO enables different data systems to speak the same language, supporting consistent integration, reuse, and automated reasoning across applications and domains.       Originally initiated by   CUBRC, Inc.   in 2010 under an IARPA Knowledge Discovery and Dissemination grant, CCO has been widely used within defense and intelligence contexts to support large-scale data integration and analysis. For many years, development and application occurred primarily in closed or mission-specific environments, shaped by operational requirements and mission-driven use cases.       Since becoming publicly available under a BSD-3 license in 2017, with an open   GitHub repository,   CCO has seen growing adoption and external engagement across research, engineering, and scientific communities. This increased visibility has supported broader collaboration, independent evaluation, and reuse of CCO as a general-purpose semantic foundation.       In 2022, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) initiated the   P3195 mid-level ontology standards project,   including formal review of CCO as part of its evaluation process. More recently, in 2024, CCO was endorsed as a baseline standard for formal ontology development across the   U.S. Department of Defense and Intelligence Community. </p> Status and Scope <p>   CCO is a maintained, modular mid-level ontology suite designed to support reuse, extension, and alignment across domain ontologies and ontology-driven systems.       The core modules are intended to remain stable over time, providing a reliable semantic backbone for modeling entities, processes, qualities, and information. Domain extensions and application-specific ontologies are designed to evolve in response to new requirements and emerging use cases.       Development of CCO is ongoing and community-informed. Ontology updates are supported by open documentation, public discussion, and structured engagement activities that promote transparency in design decisions and practical application.       This approach allows CCO to remain stable at its core while continuing to evolve in response to new domains, emerging requirements, and interoperability challenges. </p> Community and Use in Practice <p>   The Common Core Ontologies are not only a formal ontology suite, but also the focus of active community engagement aimed at supporting practical use.       CCO is developed, discussed, and refined through open standards efforts, technical development groups, and user-facing forums. These activities are structured to support multiple levels of engagement.       New users often begin by attending office hours or consulting documentation to understand how CCO is applied in practice. More experienced users may participate in working groups or developer discussions focused on extending CCO, aligning it with related ontologies, or contributing to standards initiatives.       Across these activities, emphasis is placed on practical modeling questions, reuse of established design patterns, and transparency in architectural decisions. </p> Common Core Ontologies <p> The diagram below illustrates the structure of CCO and its core modules, showing how they extend from Basic Formal Ontology and support domain-specific extensions. </p> List of Common Core Modules <p> The table below lists the core CCO modules and summarizes the scope of each, illustrating how the suite provides reusable, domain-neutral building blocks for applied ontology development. </p> Common Core Module Scope Geospatial Ontology Designed to represent sites, spatial regions, and other entities, especially those that are located near the surface of Earth, as well as the relations that hold between them. Information Entity Ontology Designed to represent generic types of information as well as the relationships between information and other entities. Event Ontology Designed to represent processual entities, especially those performed by agents, that occur within multiple domains. Time Ontology Designed to represent temporal regions and the relations that hold between them. Agent Ontology Designed to represent agents, especially persons and organizations, and their roles. Quality Ontology Designed to represent a range of attributes of entities especially qualities, realizable entities, and process profiles. Units of Measure Ontology Designed to represent standard measurement units that are used when measuring various attributes of entities. Currency Unit Ontology Designed to represent the currencies that countries issue and use. Facility Ontology Designed to represent buildings and campuses that are designed to serve some specific purpose, and which are common to multiple domains. Artifact Ontology Designed to represent artifacts that are common to multiple domains along with their models, specifications, and functions. Extended Relations Ontology Designed to represent many of the relations that hold between entities at the level of the mid-level Common Core Ontologies."},{"location":"affiliates/","title":"Affiliates","text":"Organizations <p>   CCO development and governance are supported through collaboration with academic, government, and industry partners. </p>"},{"location":"board/","title":"Board of Directors","text":"Board of Directors The Common Core Board of Directors <p> Over the past decade, the Common Core Ontologies (CCO) have become a widely used semantic foundation for U.S. Government and research organizations.

By introducing entities such as geospatial boundary, geospatial line, and geospatial polygon, CCO\u2019s geospatial design patterns resemble those of GeoSPARQL which maintains a vocabulary of points and polygons from which users may construct query patterns concerning spatial location. However, GeoSPARQL does not provide query extensions or native support for interactions between both space and time, instead directing users to leverage OWL TIME to model the latter. In contrast, CCO integrates spatial, temporal, and spatiotemporal aspects of tracking.</p> <p>Suppose there is a need to represent the path taken by a ground vehicle over some geospatial region. The first figure below illustrates how such a use case would be modeled using CCO. The class material artifact - a material entity designed by some agent to realize some function - is the parent of vehicle, instances of which convey material entities from one location to another. Subclasses of vehicle are divided largely along the lines of aircraft, ground vehicle, spacecraft, and watercraft, all of which are designed to realize some conveyance function across some environment type. While any instance of truck is a ground vehicle, the latter class is further divided into rail transport vehicle \u2013 conveyance by railway - and ground motor vehicle \u2013 conveyance by motive power by an engine absent rails \u2013 where we find truck.</p> <p>Tracing the path of an instance of truck involves identifying an act of vehicle use in which that truck participates. The act of vehicle use in turn has process part some location changes which occur at instances of vehicle track point. Generally, the relation occurs at holds between a process and a site, where a site is a three-dimensional immaterial entity whose boundaries coincide with some material entity, e.g. a hole in a straw, the trunk of a car. To say then that a process part of the act of vehicle use occurs at some vehicle track point is to imply the latter is a site. Each instance of vehicle track point is associated with latitude and longitude text values, and each is a part of distinct instances of geospatial region, which is a site at or near the surface of the Earth. Each geospatial region has a different location, such as Buffalo NY, or the New York State Thruway Exit 33 Toll Plaza, or Rome NY.</p> <p>The temporal aspect of this scenario is illustrated in the next figure below. Suppose the act of vehicle use occurs at the Baghdad city of al-Kadhimya over the course of several months. One such occurrence happened during the month of May 2004. Any act of vehicle use will happen over a temporal interval, which is a continuous temporal region of one-dimension exhibiting no gaps, such as May 17th at 1:38PM EDT. This time of day is an interval during May 2004, which in this scenario is an interval during a multi- month temporal interval, perhaps consisting of June, July, and August as well. Note that, despite the label choice, multi-month temporal interval may, unlike the BFO class temporal interval, exhibit discontinuities and temporal gaps. The class exists to track repeated occurrences of a process across months. For more fine-grained representations, CCO additionally contains similarly contains multi-day temporal interval, multi- second temporal interval and so on.</p> <p>These resources allow for the representation of partial descriptions of processes that refer to the same event using different granularities of time. For example, the statements \u201cThe truck is in Baghdad at 8:42PM on March 17th, 2004\u201d and \u201cA truck was in Baghdad on the evening of March 17th, 2004\u201d may refer to the same event, and if so, would be linked using interval during relations.</p>"},{"location":"information/","title":"Information","text":"<p>The Information Entity Ontology distinguishes content of information both from the information bearing entities which may carry that content and from the patterns exhibited by those information bearing entities. A computer monitor screen, for example, bears qualities such as shape and color that are said to concretize information content entities, i.e. generically dependent continuants that are about something. These distinctions allow for flexible representations of various relationships arising among information bearing entities, patterns, and information content entities. Any of the following patterns \u2018\u03c0\u2019, \u2018pi\u2019, \u20183.14...\u2019, or \u20183.14159265358979323...\u2019 on your monitor might concretize the same information content entity. Similarly, such patterns in a textbook would concretize the same information content entity.</p> <p>Importantly, in making this trifold distinction, CCO denies that information transmission, provenance, and evaluation can be adequately represented without reference to information carriers. Carriers are, for example, crucial when modeling the provenance and pedigree of data across multi-modal sensors [24]. That said, users are not required to track provenance; CCO includes an annotation property \"is tokenized by\" to link literal values directly to instances of information content entity without having to represent relevant information content bearers.</p> <p>Designative information content entities are used to uniquely denote entities, while directive information content entities consist of either propositions or images used to prescribe behaviors, actions, designs, etc. The class descriptive information content entity consists of propositions used to describe some entity and is the parent to the extensive collection of measurement and measurement unit CCO classes. CCO distinguishes what is being measured, information about what is measured, units encoding measurements, and the findings regarding measurements. For example, measuring John\u2019s height in inches involves John, a length quality that inheres in John, the inch unit of measure, and the value associated with John\u2019s height, e.g. \u201c70\u201d</p> <p>To illustrate features of CCO\u2019s information design pattern, consider that automobiles are often designed by agents or organizations according to some blueprint or modeling pattern. The Agent Ontology contains classes for agents, organizations, and roles borne by either. In CCO, agents are in every case those material entities capable of performing planned acts, i.e. acts directed by some directive information content entity. Moreover, by leveraging a sub-relation of participates in, namely agent in, CCO distinguishes between agents making causally relevant contributions to some process as opposed to passive contributions. For example, engineers working for Honda at some point created a blueprint for the Honda Civic, and so provided causally relevant contributions to the creation of this blueprint. Expanding on this example, CCO introduces the class artifact model, a directive information content entity that prescribes a common set of functions and qualities to inhere in a set of artifact instances. Instances of artifact model are, moreover, designated by specific artifact model names, such as \u201c2018 Tesla Model 3-EU var2\u201d which may similarly be represented using CCO resources</p> <p>Given an artifact model prescribing the production features for a type of automobile, manufacturers also engage in planned acts the goal of which is to satisfy the artifact model prescriptions. Manufacturers may, for example, produce an automobile that is meant to bear a certain weight or have a certain transportation range function. These dependent entities will then inhere in the automobile produced and may be measured by some information content entity. As depicted in Figure 3, each ratio measurement information content entity corresponds to its own information bearing entity, which we may assume without loss of generality that in this case is part of some database or table. With respect to the weight of the automobile, the relevant database part has a literal value \u201c1250\u201d and uses measurement unit kilogram measurement unit.</p> <p>Artifact models are rarely, if ever, faithfully produced. CCO resources allow for representations of the goals of an artifact model, the extent to which attempts to produce that model were successful, and manufacturer plans in pursuit of such production. When representing data reflecting failures of plans, missed opportunities, or perhaps even unobtainable goals, such nuanced representations are invaluable.</p>"},{"location":"news/","title":"News","text":"<p>This page will host official announcements, release notes, and community updates for the Common Core Ontologies (CCO) project.</p>"},{"location":"news/#coming-soon","title":"Coming Soon","text":"<p>An announcement regarding the March 2026 major release will be published here shortly.</p>"},{"location":"office-hours/","title":"Office Hours","text":"<p> BFO-CCO Office Hours </p> BFO-CCO Office Hours <p> Given the growing importance of Basic Formal Ontology and the Common Core Ontologies across domains such as defense and intelligence, biology and medicine, and service and manufacturing, the lead developers of BFO and CCO host biweekly office hours to support transparency and accessibility around their development and use.
